# Email_Spam_Detection

Email Spam Detection Project

This repository contains code and resources for an Email Spam Detection project. The project focuses on using machine learning techniques to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). It includes preprocessing steps such as text cleaning and feature extraction, as well as the implementation of machine learning algorithms for training and evaluation.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw email text data into a suitable format for machine learning.
- Feature extraction: Using techniques like regex to convert text data into numerical features.
- Machine learning models: Implementation and evaluation of  Naive Bayes classification algorithms for spam detection.
- Performance metrics: Calculation of precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy and ROC Curve to assess the effectiveness of the models.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Detailed notebooks showcasing the step-by-step process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Feel free to explore the code, notebooks, and resources provided in this repository to gain insights into email spam detection using machine learning techniques. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
