# Email Spam Detection Project

Welcome to the Email Spam Detection Project repository! This project aims to provide a solution for automatically identifying spam emails using machine learning techniques. With the increasing volume of emails in our inboxes, it's crucial to have an effective system in place to filter out unwanted and potentially harmful spam messages.

## Project Overview

Spam emails are a nuisance and can potentially lead to security risks. This project tackles the challenge of detecting such emails using natural language processing and classification algorithms. By analyzing the text content and various features of emails, we aim to build a robust and accurate model that can differentiate between legitimate emails and spam.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing: We preprocess the email text by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and tokenizing words.
- Feature Extraction: We use techniques like regex to extract important features from the email text.
- Classification Algorithms: We implement various classification algorithms, such as Naive Bayes to train our model on labeled data.
- Model Evaluation: We assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and ROC Curve.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook to train the model and test it on sample data.
4. Explore the code, modify parameters, and experiment with different algorithms to enhance the model's performance.
